# Cyber-Physical Systems Security & Safety Projects (CPSS)

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository contains three Cyber-Physical Systems Security & Safety (CPSS) course projects covering CPS architecture security analysis, control system simulation with cyber attack scenarios, and machine learning-based IoT attack detection.

The projects demonstrate how cyber components, physical processes, and security mechanisms interact in real-world CPS environments such as smart vehicles and IoT systems.
